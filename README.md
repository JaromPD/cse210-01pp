Play a card guessing game. You are given a card and asked to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the initial card.
If you guess correctly you get 100 points, if you guess incorrectly you lose 75 points. Every player starts with 300 points.

If you get a higher score than the previous high score you can add your score and username to the highscore.json file and overwrite the old score.
